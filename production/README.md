# Production Data

## JLCPCB files

These are JLC production BOM/position files.  
The entire unit can be ordered pre-assembled using the economic PCBA option.  


## Other data

The gerber files are located in `kicad-source/Gerber`.  
The raw (non-JLC-tuned) BOM file is located at `kicad-source/CustomUPDIProgrammer.csv`.  
The raw (non-JLC-tuned) position files are located at `kicad-source/Position`.  


## Recommended options

Select HASL-LeadFree or ENIG options - since the tool will likely be held by hand directly during use, lead-included finishes are highly discouraged.
